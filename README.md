# React Flux minimal example

This project shows a minimal understanding of the Flux pattern using ECMAScript 6

To run the example you need to have npm installed on your machine.

From the root of the project run 

```
npm install
```
and 
```
gulp webpack-dev-server
```
The task will run an internal server at the following URL
```
http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html
```
Enjoy!
