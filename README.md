# React Flux minimal example

This project shows a minimal understanding of the Flux pattern using ECMAScript 6

To run the example you need to have npm installed on your machine.

From the root of the project run 

```
npm install
```
and 
```
gulp webpack-dev-server
```
The task will run an internal server at the following URL
```
http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html
```

If you already have a local webserver, just run the following command and it will build all the files in one single file. The project already have a built version.
```
gulp webpack
```


Enjoy!
